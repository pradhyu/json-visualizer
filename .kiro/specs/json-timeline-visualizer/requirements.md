# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This VSCode extension provides a comprehensive visualization tool for JSON files containing array data with temporal information. The extension displays entities as time series blocks with configurable start/end dates, colors by array key, and includes both graphical and tabular views with interactive filtering capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to visualize JSON array entities in a time series graph, so that I can understand temporal relationships and patterns in my data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a JSON file is opened THEN the extension SHALL detect arrays within the file
2. WHEN arrays are detected THEN the extension SHALL display entities as colored blocks on a timeline
3. WHEN displaying blocks THEN each block SHALL have a start and end position based on configured date properties
4. WHEN displaying blocks THEN each array key SHALL have a distinct color for visual differentiation
5. WHEN displaying the timeline THEN the latest date SHALL appear on the left with chronological progression to the right

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure fluent paths to JSON arrays and their date properties, so that I can work with different JSON structures flexibly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the extension THEN the user SHALL be able to define fluent paths to target JSON arrays
2. WHEN configuring arrays THEN the user SHALL be able to specify multiple array paths in a single JSON file
3. WHEN configuring date properties THEN the user SHALL be able to define fluent paths for start date properties
4. WHEN configuring date properties THEN the user SHALL be able to define fluent paths for end date properties
5. WHEN configuring Y-axis THEN the user SHALL be able to define integer attribute paths for vertical positioning

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want interactive time series functionality with zoom and pan capabilities, so that I can explore data at different time granularities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the timeline THEN the user SHALL be able to zoom in and out of the time range
2. WHEN viewing the timeline THEN the user SHALL be able to pan left and right across time
3. WHEN zooming in THEN the X-axis labels SHALL automatically adjust from months to weeks to days
4. WHEN at default zoom level THEN each X-axis tick SHALL represent days
5. WHEN interacting with the chart THEN the changes SHALL be smooth and responsive

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want a tabular view of JSON entries with filtering and editing capabilities, so that I can examine, filter, and modify data in detail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing data THEN the extension SHALL display a tabular representation of JSON entries
2. WHEN viewing the table THEN each column SHALL have filter controls
3. WHEN applying filters to the table THEN the time series chart SHALL automatically update to show only filtered entities
4. WHEN viewing table entries THEN labels SHALL clearly indicate which JSON array key each object belongs to
5. WHEN configuring the table THEN array keys SHALL be used to define object types
6. WHEN viewing the table THEN columns SHALL be editable by the user
7. WHEN editing table data THEN a save button SHALL be available to persist changes
8. WHEN hitting save THEN the changes SHALL be written back to the original JSON file

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to toggle between different view modes, so that I can focus on the visualization type that best suits my current needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the extension THEN the user SHALL have checkboxes to enable/disable the time series graph
2. WHEN using the extension THEN the user SHALL have checkboxes to enable/disable the tabular view
3. WHEN using checkboxes THEN the user SHALL be able to show both views simultaneously
4. WHEN toggling views THEN the interface SHALL update immediately to reflect the selection
5. WHEN views are hidden THEN the remaining view SHALL utilize the available screen space efficiently

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to work with entire directories of JSON files, so that I can visualize and compare data across multiple files simultaneously.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN opening the extension THEN the user SHALL have an option to open an entire directory
2. WHEN a directory is opened THEN the extension SHALL provide a file explorer on the left-hand side
3. WHEN viewing the file explorer THEN JSON files SHALL be displayed with checkboxes
4. WHEN using checkboxes THEN the user SHALL be able to select which JSON files to plot
5. WHEN files are selected THEN the time series chart SHALL display data from all selected files
6. WHEN viewing the tabular view THEN a filename column SHALL be included showing the source file
7. WHEN filtering the table THEN the filename column SHALL be filterable like other columns

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want configurable block identifiers and tooltips, so that I can customize what information is displayed on the timeline blocks and hover details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the extension THEN the user SHALL be able to define which property serves as the block ID
2. WHEN displaying blocks THEN the configured ID SHALL be shown inside each timeline block
3. WHEN configuring tooltips THEN the user SHALL be able to select which columns appear in hover tooltips
4. WHEN viewing the tabular view THEN checkboxes SHALL allow selection of tooltip columns
5. WHEN hovering over blocks THEN the selected tooltip information SHALL be displayed
6. WHEN no ID is configured THEN blocks SHALL display a default identifier

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear visual indicators and labels, so that I can easily understand which data belongs to which array and time period.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying blocks THEN each block SHALL be clearly labeled with the configured identifier
2. WHEN displaying multiple arrays THEN each array SHALL have a distinct color scheme
3. WHEN viewing the timeline THEN date labels SHALL be clearly visible and appropriately formatted
4. WHEN viewing Y-axis values THEN integer attributes SHALL be displayed with appropriate scaling
5. WHEN hovering over blocks THEN configurable tooltip details SHALL be shown

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want extensive test coverage with sample files for various configuration scenarios, so that I can ensure the extension works reliably across different JSON structures and use cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing the extension THEN sample JSON files SHALL be provided for different data structures
2. WHEN testing configurations THEN samples SHALL include nested arrays at various depths
3. WHEN testing date formats THEN samples SHALL include ISO dates, timestamps, and custom date formats
4. WHEN testing Y-axis configurations THEN samples SHALL include different integer attribute types and ranges
5. WHEN testing multiple arrays THEN samples SHALL include JSON files with 2-5 different array types
6. WHEN testing edge cases THEN samples SHALL include empty arrays, missing properties, and malformed dates
7. WHEN testing directory functionality THEN sample directories SHALL contain 5-10 JSON files with varying structures
8. WHEN testing filtering THEN samples SHALL include data that can be meaningfully filtered by different criteria
9. WHEN testing editing THEN samples SHALL include data that can be safely modified and saved
10. WHEN testing performance THEN samples SHALL include large datasets with 100+ entries per array
11. WHEN testing configuration scenarios THEN samples SHALL demonstrate simple, medium, and complex fluent path configurations
12. WHEN testing real-world scenarios THEN samples SHALL include project timelines, event logs, resource scheduling, and deployment histories
